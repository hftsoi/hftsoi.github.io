My research focuses on experimental particle physics at the CERN [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) in Switzerland, and on the development of novel machine learning algorithms for both conventional and low-latency domains to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at UPenn working in Dylan Rankin's group on the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern) experiment.
I received my PhD in Physics from U.Wisconsin-Madison in 2024, where I worked in Sridhara Dasu's group on the [CMS](https://cms.cern/collaboration) experiment and my thesis ["Search for exotic Higgs boson decays with CMS and fast machine learning solutions for the LHC"](https://repository.cern/records/tgfn2-52h79) earned the [CMS Thesis Award](https://cms.cern/news/cms-phd-thesis-award-winners-2024) from CERN.

My recent work lies in the following areas, with the objective centered on experimental particle physics.
- Self-supervised learning pretraining methods
- Low-latency (sub-microsecond) ML algorithms on FPGAs
- Neuromorphic computing with spiking neural networks
- Anomaly detection
- Symbolic regression
- Search for exotic Higgs boson decays
- Trigger system
